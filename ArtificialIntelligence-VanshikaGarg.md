Artificial means made or produced by human beings rather than occuring naturally. Intelligence means the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.Hence, the Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.
Machines Mimicking Human Intelligence which can be considered as Artificial Intelligence are speech recognition,learning,planning,problem solving etc.
The central principles of AI include:
1.Reasoning,Knowledge,Planning,Learning,Communication.
2.Perception and the ability to move and manipulation objects.
3.Its the science & Engineering of making intelligence machines,especially intelligent computer programs.
4.The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour.
The first appearance of AI is in greek myths,like TALOS of create or the bronze robot of Hephaestus.AI research revived in 1980s because of the popularity of expert system,which simulated
teh knowledge of a human expets.By 1985,1 Billion dollars were spent on AI. AI revived again in 90s and early 2000s with ots use in data mining and medical diagnosis. This was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems.
AI has become a technological reality for businesses and organization across industries.Even if its benefits may not be always easy to quantify.AI has proven itself capable of improving process efficiency,reducing human errors and labor,and extracting insights from
big data.
Application of AI is AI in medicine,AI in music,telecommunication,Robotics and AI,AI in Gaming,AI in Banking.looking at teh features and its wide application we may definitely stick to
AI.Seeing at the development of AI is it thet the future world is becoming Artificial.Biological intelligence is fixed , because it is an old,mature paradigm but the new paradigm of non bilogical 
computation and intelligence is growing exponentially.
